  s.description      = <<-DESC
Various extensions and functions. Some are written by me, some are
collected online. And some are variations. This framework is supposed
to give you a faster start with your project by combining some useful
and often used code. Includes few UI classes extending UILabel as well
since extensions for UILabel could not provide this functionality.

 - Merged: LocaleKit support. LocaleKit allows a fixed App wide locale to be defined.
 - Merged: NumPad. NumPad for both iPhone and iPad, also with phone style keypad.
 - Merged: MathKit support. Math extensions are now merged to CommonKit.
 - Merged: DateKit support. Extension to Date and general helpers to handle dates in UTC timezone.
 - Merged: DispatchKit. Extensions to DispatchQueue and a simple but powerful backgrounding Task Manager support.
