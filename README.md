# CommonKit
A Swift framework with some common extensions and functions

### Contents
Various extensions and functions. Some are written by me, some are collected online. And some are variations.
This framework is supposed to give you a faster start with your project by combining some useful and often used code. Includes few UI classes extending UILabel as well since extensions for UILabel could not provide this functionality.

### CocoaPods
CommonKit is now available through CocoaPods.
Here's a sample Podfile:
'''
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'

# inhibit_all_warnings!
use_frameworks!

platform :ios, '11.0'

target 'YOURPROJECT' do
        pod 'CommonKit', git: 'https://github.com/oskarirauta/CommonKit.git'
end
'''
